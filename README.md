The **function** helps us give rewards to people using a special kind of money called cUSD.

First, we find out how much cUSD the person has. Then, we check if the person wants us to add their cUSD rewards to a special app called Wallet Connect, or if they want us to add the rewards to a different address.

If the person wants us to use Wallet Connect, we find out what their Wallet Connect address is, and then we add all their cUSD rewards to that address.

If the person wants us to use a different address, we add all their cUSD rewards to that address instead.

That's it! Now the person can use their cUSD rewards however they want.
